# ODW2016-Meet-The-Family
An example app to show you how you can easily use the box tools to build an app, from the ground up.
This app will be used as a walk through demo for the Ortus Developer Week 2016 session called "Meet the Family"

The master branch will only contain the readme file. 
A new branch will be created for each step of the app creation... building on the previous branch.

- This app will not require a database, for demonstration purposes, we'll use mocked data.
- The app will be run using commandbox, defaulting to Lucee
